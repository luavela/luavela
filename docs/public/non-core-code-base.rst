Non-Core Code Base
===================

DynASM
------

TBD.

CMake
-----
 
 `KDE CMake Coding Style <https://community.kde.org/Policies/CMake_Coding_Style>`_ - good place to start.

            -  Use two spaces for indentation.
            -  Use ALL_CAPS for variable names and snake_case for
               function names.
            -  Use modern target based approach
               (``target_include_directories``, not
               ``include_directories``, etc.).

Lua
--------------------

Currently the only requirement is to pass validation with the version of ``luacheck`` shipped within the repository.

Python
-------

Currently the only requirement is to pass validation with the latest version of flake8.

Perl
-----

TBD.

Shell
-----

TBD.
