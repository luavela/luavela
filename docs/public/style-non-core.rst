TBD.

CMake

`KDE CMake Coding Style <https://community.kde.org/Policies/CMake_Coding_Style>`_ - good place to start.

   -  Use two spaces for indentation.
   -  Use ALL_CAPS for variable names and snake_case for function names.
   -  Use modern target based approach (``target_include_directories``, not ``include_directories``, etc.).

Currently the only requirement is to pass validation with the version of ``luacheck`` shipped within the repository.

Python
------

Currently the only requirement is to pass validation with the latest version of flake8.
