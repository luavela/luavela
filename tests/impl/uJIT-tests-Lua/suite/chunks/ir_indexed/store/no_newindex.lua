-- This test assumes that JIT is on, starts recording on 2-th iteration and
-- fails.

jit.on()
assert(jit.status())
jit.opt.start('hotloop=1')

-- Trace recorder fails because there is no MM for number.

	-- Recording starts here.
	if (i == 2) then
		local _
		-- JIT recorder will fail here since '_' doesn't has a metatable.
		_[0] = "mystring"
	end
