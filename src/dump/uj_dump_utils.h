 * to fmt_buf to mark a stripped output. Returns number of octets written.
 * Correct length of fmt_buf should be ensured by the caller.
 * NB! This implementation differs from the original dumpers:
 * -- bc.lua:
 *     kc = format(#kc > 40 and '"%.40s"~' or '"%s"', gsub(kc, "%c", ctlsub))
 * -- dump.lua (IR dumper):
 *     s = format(#k > 20 and '"%.20s"~' or '"%s"', gsub(k, "%c", ctlsub))
 * as it guarantees that possible trailing escape sequence will never be
 * incorrectly stripped.
