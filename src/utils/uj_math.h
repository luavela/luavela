/*
 * Simple binary(mostly) calculator for doubles.
 * Works on different sets of operation encodings within uJIT, namely:
 * - IR operations in narrow and fold optimizations.
 * - Metamethods for numeric types when string coercion is performed.
 * - Parser operation tokens when parsing something like 'local a = 5 + 7'.
 *
 * Since the algorithm works on different encodings, it is merely a generic
 * algorithm (something like std::sort in C++). Like any generic algorithm,
 * it applies some restrictions to the underlying data, but since C does not
 * provide established interface mechanism, we only _ask_ all encodings that
 * want to use this algorithm the following:
 * - Encoding should implement a subset of described operations (possibly not
 *   all of them). For example, parser does not have atan2 token since it's
 *   a function.
 * - Relative positions of operations in the encoding (as passed to the
 *   algorithm) should be as this function requires. For example, if OP_ADD
 *   and OP_SUB are defined, OP_SUB should be 1 plus OP_ADD. This will allow
 *   to call uj_math_foldarith directly like (x, y, op-OP_ADD). This restriction
 *   is historically called ORDER ARITH and is found here and there in the
 *   sources. It might actually be violated by converting source operations
 *   to ORDER ARITH explicitly, but it's considered a bad practice.
