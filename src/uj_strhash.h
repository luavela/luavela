/*
 * String hash is a collection of unique GCstr objects. This means
 * that, when properly used, all contained objects will have different
 * string payload.
 * String hash does not retain any ownership of actual string objects.
 * This means that the object should be constructed prior to insertion
 * in the hash and somehow managed after eviction from the hash. Also,
 * uj_strhash_destroy must only be called on empty hashes.
 * The general workflow is as follows:
 * 1) A struct of type uj_strhash_t is allocated.
 * 2) "mask" field of the struct is set to ~0 (see uj_state.c).
 * 3) String interning is done via uj_strhash_find and uj_strhash_add.
 *    Note that uj_strhash_add itself does not check object uniqueness.
 *    One must check that string is not present in the hash and only call
 *    uj_strhash_add afterwards.
 * 4) The most common scenario of evicting a string from the hash is inside
 *    the garbage collector. GC operates on hash internals directly and
 *    manages evicted objects itself.
 * 5) One special scenario is evicting sealed objects from regular string hash
 *    and moving them to sealed string hash. Corresponding function is present.
 * 6) Hash shrinking is available if too many strings were evicted from it.
 *    This allows to spare some memory.
 * 7) As the hash itself allocates some memory, it must be properly destroyed.
 *    To avoid memory leaks, the hash must only be destroyed when all strings
 *    are already evicted from it.
